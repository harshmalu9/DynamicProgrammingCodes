i want to solve the leetcode problem number 1161, i know the basic procedure to solve the question but i am struggling at certain steps, so i want you to guide me through and train me to solve this problem, i would be asking you specific doubts so give me the answer to those, rather than providing the whole solution, the goal is to make me learn the concept rather than just getting the solution ready
